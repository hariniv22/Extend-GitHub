# Overview of the analysis

The main purpose of the analysis is to provide a way for volunteers to be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

Using d3 & plotly, 3 different charts are created - Bar graph, Bubble chart and Gauge chart. When a sample ID is selected from the drop-down menu, the page is populated with the demographic info as well as 3 different charts that meet the requirements of the selected sample. Styling of the page is also customized with colors & different font sizes to make it look pretty.
